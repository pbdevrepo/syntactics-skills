# Changelog

All notable changes to syntactics-skills are documented here.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- `engineering-workflow`: `sync-dev-tdd` — unified TDD skill covering red-green-refactor philosophy, tracer bullets, and vertical slicing; detects session type (BE/FE/FS) and generates Swagger YAML (`docs/api/{module}/{feature}_api.yaml`) for backend and full-stack sessions; frontend-only sessions skip Swagger output
- `references/swagger-output-format.md` (`sync-dev-tdd`) — full OpenAPI 3.0.3 YAML template with shared response schemas and security scheme

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- `sales-workflow`: `sync-proposal-revision` — handles client feedback and revision rounds on an existing proposal; reads client comments, diffs against the latest requirements version (not always v1), produces a new versioned `{project-name}-requirements-v{N}.md` with a Revision History section and delta summary, then chains to `sync-proposal-writer` and `sync-quotation`

### Changed
- `sales-workflow`: `sync-proposal-writer` v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0 — revision-aware versioning; detects existing proposals to determine the next version number; writes `{project-name}-proposal-v{N}.md` for revisions (first proposal retains no suffix for backward compatibility); adds a "Revision Summary" section to v2+ proposals; self-review checklist includes version label consistency check
- `references/template-structure.md` (`sync-proposal-writer`) — `Version: 1.0` replaced with `Version: {proposal-version}` placeholder; added Revision Summary block template (with note to omit for the initial proposal)

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- `engineering-workflow`: `sync-dev-session` — implementation grilling session anchored to FDD; asks BE, FE, or Full-Stack session type; saves structured summary to `docs/sessions/{be|fe|fullstack}/{topic}-{date}.md`; ends with explicit handoff to `sync-tdd-be` or `sync-tdd-fe`
- `engineering-workflow`: `sync-tdd-be` — TDD-driven backend implementation loop per task; generates full Swagger YAML for all API endpoints in the module at once to `docs/api/{module}/{feature}_api.yaml`
- `engineering-workflow`: `sync-tdd-fe` — TDD-driven frontend implementation loop per task; mirrors `sync-tdd-be` pattern without Swagger output
- `engineering-workflow`: `sync-dev-to-fix` — TDD-driven bug fix loop invoked with a GitHub issue link; fetches issue via GitHub MCP, runs failing test - fix - verify cycle, posts completion comment, applies `ready-for-qa` label; blocks on `out-of-scope` issues with `for-ba-confirmation` label
- `qa-workflow`: `sync-qa-planner` — generates structured QA test plan from FDD + frontend/backend task lists; replaces deprecated `sync-qa-tester`; output to `projects/{project-name}/qa/{project-name}-qa-plan.md`
- `qa-workflow`: `sync-qa-runner` — executes test plan live via Playwright MCP (UI/E2E) and HTTP requests (API); marks PASS/FAIL inline; generates reusable Playwright regression spec files to `docs/qa/{module}/{feature}.spec.ts`; supports local, staging, and custom URL environments
- `qa-workflow`: `sync-qa-to-ticket` — converts QA failures and manual findings into GitHub issues via GitHub MCP; auto-bootstraps full label set on first run; applies type + priority + `needs-triage` on creation; never provides fix suggestions; flags out-of-scope issues with `for-ba-confirmation`
- `references/session-summary-format.md` (`sync-dev-session`) — structured session summary template with Context, Decisions Made, Constraints Identified, Open Questions, Next Steps, Risks, and References sections
- `references/swagger-output-format.md` (`sync-tdd-be`) — full OpenAPI 3.0.3 YAML template with shared response schemas and security scheme
- `references/test-plan-format.md` (`sync-qa-planner`) — test case block structure with Execution Type and Test Run Log fields
- Label convention: Type (`bug`, `out-of-scope`, `regression`), Status (`needs-triage`, `ready-for-dev`, `in-fix`, `ready-for-qa`, `verified`), Escalation (`for-ba-confirmation`, `needs-info`), Priority (`P1-critical` through `P4-low`)

### Removed
- `design-dev-workflow`: `sync-qa-tester` — deprecated and removed; replaced by `sync-qa-planner` in `qa-workflow`
- `design-dev-workflow`: `sync-bug-fixer` — removed; replaced by `sync-qa-to-ticket` (issue creation) and `sync-dev-to-fix` (TDD fix execution)

### Changed
- `README.md` — added `engineering-workflow` and `qa-workflow` skill tables; updated workflow sequence diagram to reflect new engineering chain
- `CONTEXT.md` — updated Design&Dev and Engineering workflow sequences

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `content-workflow`: `sync-web-content-writer` - write and optimize static web pages (homepages, service pages, about pages, landing pages, FAQ sections, portfolio entries) for Google and AI agent citation
- `content-workflow`: `sync-article-writer` - write and optimize blog posts and articles (how-to guides, listicles, opinion pieces, pillar content, news articles) for Google and AI agent citation
- `content-workflow`: `sync-content-strategist` - audit existing content for SEO and AI readability issues, rewrite top flagged sections, and produce prioritized content strategy recommendations
- `references/intake.md` (all content skills) - pre-writing intake checklist: required client context before any content is produced, with mode-specific fields and `[FILL IN]` fallback convention

### Changed
- `content-workflow` references: deliverable format defined per skill (title tag, meta, H1, body, FAQ, schema type note)
- `references/audit-rewrite.md`: default rewrite scope added (top 3 flagged sections in full; remaining issues listed with one-line fix each)
- `references/schema-snippets.md`: usage gate added - templates only for explicit JSON-LD requests or full audits

### Removed
- `content-workflow`: `sync-ai-content-writer` - replaced by the three focused skills above

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `sales-workflow`: `sync-client-discovery` — pre-requirement discovery skill for clients with no brief; generates structured questions across business goals, project type, budget/timeline, and tech/design preferences; produces a `{project-name}-discovery.md` artifact that feeds into `sync-requirement-analyzer`

- Artifact path convention: `projects/{project-name}/{workflow-phase}/{artifact}.md`
- CLI tool (`bin/cli.js`) for one-command installation: `npx syntactics-skills@latest add pbdevrepo/syntactics-skills`
- GitHub Actions workflow to build and release with source code ZIP
- Simplified installation: no local scripts needed, just npx command downloads from GitHub releases

### Removed
- `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/deploy-local.sh`, `scripts/validate.sh`, `scripts/bump-version.sh` - replaced with CLI and CI
- `scripts/link-skills.sh`, `scripts/list-skills.sh` - replaced with direct CLI functionality

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- `ba-project-intake` v1.0.0 → v1.0.1
  - Description: added trigger phrases (`"project requirements"`, `"client brief"`, `"we got a new project"`)
  - Phase 2: cap inline table at 15 modules; summarize remainder
  - Phase 3: all-clear shortcut (skip questions when no ambiguity), 5–10 question limit, Phase 3b re-loop for answers that open new gaps
  - Phase 4: graceful fallback when `present_files` unavailable
  - `references/question-bank.md`: question limit + prioritization order at top

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `scripts/install.ps1` — Windows one-time install: clones repo, deploys skills, injects auto-update hook into `~/.claude/settings.json`
- `scripts/install.sh` — Mac/Linux equivalent; uses node to safely merge JSON settings
- Auto-update hook: `git pull --ff-only` + `deploy-local.js` fires via `UserPromptSubmit` hook, timestamp-gated to 30-min intervals

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `package.json` with npm scripts: `validate`, `build`, `deploy:local`, `dev`, `bump`
- `scripts/validate-skills.js` — validates frontmatter fields (`name`, `description`, `version`) and semver format; blocks CI on failure
- `scripts/deploy-local.js` — copies all skills to `~/.claude/skills/` for local development
- `scripts/watch.js` — file watcher (chokidar); auto-validates and deploys on `.md` change
- `scripts/bump-version.js` — detects changed skills via git diff, bumps semver in SKILL.md frontmatter
- `scripts/build-skills.js` — packages each skill into a `dist/*.skill` ZIP for distribution
- `.github/workflows/sync-skills.yml` — CI pipeline: validate → bump patch version → build ZIPs → create GitHub Release with skill assets

### Changed
- All 5 `skills/*/SKILL.md` — added `version: 1.0.0` to frontmatter
